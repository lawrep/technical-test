# Technical Test: Music REST API Enhancement

## Scenario
You’re tasked with improving a prototype .NET Core 6 REST API for a music catalog (SQLite database with artists, tracks, genres, and albums). The current codebase is functional but needs additional features and potential refinements.

## Your Tasks

### 1. Implement New Endpoints
- **Retrieve all genres**
- **Generate a summary** of song counts per genre
- **Search songs** with:
  - Optional filters (by artist, genre, album, or track name)
  - Pagination support
  - In-memory cache (Use .Net In-Memory Cache)
- *You are free to add or modify URLs and refactor code as needed.*- 

### 2. Document your solution
 - Include a **brief summary** (in email or a document) with:
    - What you changed and why (In case you found improvements).
    - Additional improvements you’d make with more time
    - Potential issues or optimizations you identified but didn’t address

## Process
1. **Fork** this repository: `https://github.com/lawrep/technical-test`
2. **Develop & refine** (~2 hours suggested):
   - Prioritize required endpoints first
   - Modify/refactor freely
3. **Submit your work**:
   - Reply to the test email with a link to your forked repository. 
   

## Evaluation Criteria
- We’ll assess:
    - **Functionality**: Working endpoints with filters, pagination, and caching
    - **Code quality**: Readability, maintainability, and proactive improvements
    - **Design choices**: Logical API structure and technical decisions
    - **Collaboration potential**: Thought process and communication in your summary

> **Note**: Time is flexible—focus on a clean, well-reasoned solution.
